# Kin Foundation - Developer Support

> Status: (0.0.0 Draft)

## Abstract

In order to best support the developers of the influx of apps that will integrate Kin, we need to revise the support structure so that it’s inclusive, transparent and well moderated.

## Audience

In this document we target developers that integrate Kin, and people that work very close to developers integrating Kin (product owners, CTO’s, etc).

Terminology:

- Integrator: A developer that integrates Kin, or their manager/cto, etc
- Ecosystem Partner: like an Integrator, but with a production app that participates in the KRE or otherwise actively participates in developing with Kin.

## Do's and Dont's

### Do

- Ask questions in the right channel.
- Try to be as complete as possible in your questions (what SDK, relevant public keys, testnet/mainnet).
- Provide a reproduction of your issue using one of the Starter Kits.
- Try to answer questions from other developers
- Be patient with things that are not urgent. We really want to help, but our resources are limited.

### Dont

- Send an email or Direct Message (DM) to people from the Kin Foundation before asking in the right Discord.
- Ping members from the Kin Foundation in each of your message, we want to encourage members helping each other.
- Invite people to our Discord that are not an _integrator_ or _ecosystem partners_. We want to keep this server focussed and professionals, without any tourists.

## Types of support

Before deciding what we need to offer, it’s probably good to define the different types of support.

### Common questions (How do I…)

When you start building with Kin, the best place for a get started are the [docs](https://kin.org/docs) and [tutorials](https://kin.org/tutorials). This should give you all information you need to get started. If this is not the case, and you have questions on how to do something, please join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/kdRyUNmHDn) and ask your question in the appropriate channel.

### Development support (It stopped working, but it can wait… Or I found a bug...)

If you found a bug in one of our projects, the best thing to do is create an issue at the relevant GitHub repo or on verify it on [Discord](https://discord.gg/kdRyUNmHDn).

The best way to show that there is an issue, is to provide a reproduction using any of projects from the **Starter Kits** found on our [Tutorial Site](https://kin.org/tutorials).

If you have issues with things on the testnet, you can ask in [Discord](https://discord.gg/kdRyUNmHDn) if any other people see the same.

### Production support (It stopped working, and it’s urgent…)

If you are an _Ecosystem Partner_, and the Kin integration your application does not work, the first step to take is ask your question in the channel `#partners-urgent` in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/kdRyUNmHDn). Explain what does not work, with as much relevant details as possible.

The `#partners-urgent` channel will be monitored by members of the tech team of the Kin Foundation, and you can expect an answer as soon as possible.

Please refrain from emailing any contacts from the Kin Foundation before having sent a message to the `#partners-urgent` channel. If you issue does not get a response in a timely manner, please make sure to send the link to your message in this channel to provide content.

Please refrain from using the `#partners-urgent` for any non-production issues.

### KRE Questions

If you are an _Ecosystem Partner_, and you have questions about your KRE payments or statisticts, the first step to take is ask your question in the channel `#partners-kre` in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/kdRyUNmHDn). Explain what does not work, with as much relevant details as possible.

The `#partners-kre` channel will be monitored by members of the tech team of the Kin Foundation, and you can expect an answer as soon as possible.

## Support Channels

The first place to look for developer support is our [Discord](https://discord.gg/kdRyUNmHDn).
